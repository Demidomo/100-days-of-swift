/*
 
 
 Design Pattern:
 - minimize complexity
 - Optomization
 
 
 Examples:
 - MVVM
 - Memento
 - Delegate
 
 Requirement dependent for different design patterns
 - Style based dependent (less lines vs. readable codes)
 
 
 MVC Model View Controller
 - Model: Separates the Data & Logic part of the code
 - View: User Interface
 - Controller: Mediator/Controller
 
 
 When an action happens from the user
 - View sends input events to controller,
 - which makes a request to the model
 - the Model sends the data back to the controller
 - which modifes the view
 
 The model and view never communicate to each other
 - this helps when the userbase is bigger
 - helps makes program much easier to understand
