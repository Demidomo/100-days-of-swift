1. create an image literal, put it in an array
2. make six of it 
3. set diceImageView1 to show one of these items in the array 
4. add a square in the back and enter the index count of the array   [dices][index]
5. replace the index value as a variable 
6. declare a variable at the start with a starting value 
7. at the end of the sequence, add a value to the variable

Keep in mind that to set the variable, it must be set outside of the loop
- this way the loop can continously add on 
- we can include a print statement to see what's going on in the block loop
