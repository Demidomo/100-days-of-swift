Have views stacked on top of each other 
Views can be horizontal aligned

Stack view method
- Select all containers with cmd key 
- editor > embed in > stack view

or bottom right


Once stacked, the stackview will require constraints 
- line the containers up along the Safe Area 
- Set constraints to the safe area in drop down, enter 0 as value 

if safe area does not show up, fine tune it in attributes 
- select the container in constraint drop down 
- select attribute and select safe area botton
and select 0

distribution = filled equally in atributes 


To have all the designs centered:
- group all the items within the container, and make it its own stackview by embedding them
- select that stackview and set horizontal and vertical alignment constraints 
- do it for all containers and test landscape 

Set transparant background 
- Select all the containers
- set background to default in attributes 

Adjusting size of the items in containers 
- select the item and set width and height to your choosing in constraints 
- there is a warning and follow through on it, confirm that is of choosing
